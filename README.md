## OoT Pre-rendered Widescreen Backgrounds
Based on OoT Reloaded, this is an option to play in widescreen with the textures in original resolution (320x240).

Why the hell would anyone play in original resolution given the existence of so many texture packs?

There is still no complete and reliable pack to the original game, which makes this pack a great option to maintain graphic consistency throughout the game.

This pack requires the use of GLideN64.
